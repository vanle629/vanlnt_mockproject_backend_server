Security testing stubs and guidance

Automated checks here are lightweight examples. For full dynamic analysis, run OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite against the running dev server.

Example payloads are provided for simple automated checks (SQLi/XSS). These are NOT exhaustive â€” use real scanners for thorough coverage.

Run examples:
- start the backend server: `node index.js` (or use the dev runner)
- run the example scripts or copy payloads into your test runner.
