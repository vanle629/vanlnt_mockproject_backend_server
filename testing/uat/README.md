User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

Checklist:
- Verify key workflows from SRS with realistic data: browse, add to cart, checkout, order history, account pages.
- Test on multiple browsers and devices (mobile viewport).
- Validate error cases: out-of-stock, failed payments, invalid inputs.

Automation notes:
- Use Playwright or Selenium to record and replay UAT flows. A minimal Playwright project can be added and configured to run user journeys.
- For manual UAT, follow the checklist and capture session videos where possible.
